// Adaptive mode (Config.AdaptiveBitrate, off by default). Once per second the
// reconcile worker updates a loss based rate estimate for every viewer
// and sends the publisher a REMB with the lowest estimate among viewers that
// are not far behind the rest. libwebrtc senders apply a received REMB as an
// upper bound on their target rate, also when transport-cc is negotiated, so
// the client needs no changes and its maxBitrate stays the ceiling. A viewer
// has no estimate (no cap, no pacing) until it reports loss over enough packets
// or a fresh REMB; then the estimate drops at once and grows by at most
// rateGrowth per second. Viewer
// writers pace primary RTP to the estimate minus measured RTX. When disabled
// nothing here runs and no REMB is sent. Transport-wide sequence numbers are
// not used: each PeerConnection keeps its own Pion interceptor state.
